        <p><time datetime="1891">1891</time> - Moves to Paris to attend the University of Paris (Sorbonne), where she studies physics and mathematics.</p>
        <p><time datetime="1893">1893</time> - Earns her degree in physics, and begins work in an industrial laboratory of Professor Gabriel Lippmann.</p>
        <p><time datetime="1894">1894</time> - Earns her degree in mathematics and meets Pierre Curie. They begin collaborating on research.</p>
        <p><time datetime="1895">1895</time> - Marries Pierre Curie.</p>
        <p><time datetime="1896">1896</time> - Inspired by Henri Becquerel's discovery of radioactivity, Marie begins her own research into uranium rays.</p>
        <p><time datetime="1898">1898</time> - Announces the discovery of two new elements, polonium and radium.</p>
        <p><time datetime="1903">1903</time> - Receives the Nobel Prize in Physics alongside Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel for their combined work on radioactivity. She becomes the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.</p>
        <p><time datetime="1906">1906</time> - Pierre Curie dies in a tragic accident. Marie Curie continues their research and takes over his teaching position at the Sorbonne, becoming the first woman to teach at the institution.</p>
        <p><time datetime="1911">1911</time> - Receives the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of radium and polonium, making her the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields.</p>
        <p><time datetime="1914">1914</time> - World War I begins. Marie Curie develops mobile radiography units, known as "Little Curies," to assist in battlefield medical care.</p>
        <p><time datetime="1918">1918</time> - After the war, she continues her research and promotes the use of radium to alleviate suffering.</p>
        <p><time datetime="1921">1921</time> - Travels to the United States to receive a gram of radium, gifted by American women to support her research.</p>
        <p><time datetime="1934">1934</time> - Dies of aplastic anemia, likely caused by prolonged exposure to radiation during her research.</p>
